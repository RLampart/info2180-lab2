    <h2>The Last Step</h2>
    <p>September 20, 2022 by Shantel Blake</p>

    <p>The first thing I did in the morning was look at the sun. My bed was placed next to the window
       so it was a simple matter of craning my neck. I loved to feel the breeze brush across
       my face as I stretched my arms out to welcome the daylight. Even when I felt like
       I would feel better in bed, that tingling heat always did a great job at waking me up.</p>
      <p>
         However, now I could barely remember the last time I had that chance. Regardless
         of whether I wanted to stay in bed or not, most of the time I had to. No one needed
         to force me, but this was not of my own volition. The doctor and my parents had tried
         to explain as kindly as possible, but the truth was simple and straightforwardly cruel.
         I would never walk again. That plain truth became a shackle on my future.

      Light from above, it shines on my tale. I wish so much, that the plot will fail.
      But I'm not dumb, I know how it ends. My desire unfulfilled, a tradegy begins, 
      even though none of it was my intention. Feeling no hope, I ascend to escape, 
      believing that a path exists above. My courage is minor, strength even smaller
      but I don't move there'll never be a way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But that choice was foolish you never had a chance. I was waiting at the door,
      proud to see last. You thought you could, that death was not in your fate, but
      here my knife comes with a test. Will you survive the stab? How long will the 
      pain last? Oh I can't wait to find the answers.
